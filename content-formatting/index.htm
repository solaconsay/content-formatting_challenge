            <h3>Block level vs Inline elements</h3>
            <p>
                The <em>&lt;p&gt; element</em> is a <strong>block level element</strong>. It occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element, and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, the <em>&lt;strong&gt; element</em> is an <strong>inline element</strong>. Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line.

            <h3>HTML Symmetry</h3>
            <p>
                <strong><em>This is my bolded and italic sentence</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a block-level section of text<br>
                <em>This sentence I want to be italic though</em>

            <h3>Other Specialized Elements</h3>
            <pre>
                Usually, all new lines and spaces (beyond one space) are ignored
                but...
                you can use the &lt;pre&gt; element to preserve the formatting - notice even the indentation is displayed on the page! Not terribly useful :(
            </pre>   

            <code>
            // This is a code block<br>
            let myMessage = "Hello World!";<br>
            window.alert(myMessage);
            </code>

            <p>
                Other specialized elements: blockquote / cite / small
            </p>
